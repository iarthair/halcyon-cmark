# Halcyon CMark

Halcyon CMark a simple python interface to call the
[cmark-gfm](https://github.com/github/cmark-gfm) API.

Unlike most other Python modules to interface to Commonmark, this one does not
make you use a modified version of cmark-gfm, just install the version that is
packaged by your distribution or build the version from GitHub.

Halcyon because it is simple and frustration free.

## Install

This is straightforward. Download source, make sure cmark-gfm is installed,
then:

```sh
$ python setup.py build
$ sudo python setup.py install
```

Python3 is assumed.  This might build for Python2.7 but I have not checked this.
